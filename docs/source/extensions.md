You can use it to control servo motors, it has 4 ouput ports, so you can connect 4 servo motors to one module at the same time, but please keep in mind that Xtron Pro's current output capacity is limited, so if you want to use it to control a high-torque servo, you need to connet an external power supply to the module.

It supports 9g servo motor with 2.54mm pitch plug by default.


### Potentiometer module
